Simulation of a Nondeterministic finite automaton with lambda moves.
This is a project designed for the Formal and Automatic Languages course, written in C++ language. 
The program receives the characteristics of an NFA with lambda moves as input and some words 
and confirms or infirms whether the word is or isnâ€™t accepted by the automaton.
